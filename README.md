Motion History Image-Based Feature Extraction and Machine Learning for Fall Detection

Abstract
Fall detection is essential in healthcare monitoring, particularly for elderly individuals. This study proposes an efficient approach leveraging Motion History Images (MHI) to capture temporal motion patterns for detecting falls. The MHI technique accumulates motion over time, highlighting recent movements while gradually fading older ones, thereby preserving motion direction and intensity. To enhance motion contrast, histogram equalization is first applied to RGB frames, followed by MHI computation. The generated MHI is then vectorized and used to train machine learning classifiers, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Logistic Regression., ensuring robust fall detection. The proposed method effectively models motion sequences while maintaining computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time deployment. Experimental results confirm that MHI-based feature extraction, combined with ML classifiers, achieves high accuracy in distinguishing falls from normal activities, providing a reliable and scalable solution for automated fall detection.
